1. Install Tampermonkey
2. Install Script "Reddit Auto Unsaved-0.1.user.js" (Reddit Auto Unsaved with Draggable Button.user.js for newer and better)
3. Navigate to url : https://old.reddit.com/user/yourusername/saved
4. It will automatic unsave all post, and keep refreshing page if there are more saved post, it only stopped once there's no more saved post

* Make sure create a backup data before doing this, by go to https://www.reddit.com/settings/data-request. I think this data-request have much more data than you manual scrolling down in Saved page on both old and new reddit design.
